# FPL Team Picker (Auto FPL)

Auto FPL is an application that acts as a readonly wrapper around your FPL team. It provides data-driven optimization for Fantasy Premier League team selection using advanced algorithms and statistical analysis.

## üéØ Main Features

1. **Optimal Team Calculation** - Uses mathematical optimization to suggest the best possible team configuration
2. **Expected Points Analysis** - Leverages xP (expected points) data for informed decision making
3. **Real-time Data Integration** - Connects directly to the official FPL API for up-to-date information

## üöÄ Use Cases

### 1. Calculate Transfers
- Analyzes your current team and suggests optimal player transfers
- Considers transfer costs (-4 points) vs potential point gains
- Evaluates both short-term and long-term transfer strategies
- Takes into account upcoming fixtures, player form, and injury status

### 2. Calculate Wildcard
- Builds an entirely new optimized team when using your wildcard chip
- No transfer cost constraints - complete team reconstruction
- Optimizes budget allocation across all positions (GK, DEF, MID, FWD)
- Considers team diversity and fixture difficulty

### 3. TOTS (Team of the Season)
- Identifies the highest-performing players across the entire season
- Useful for end-of-season analysis and planning
- Helps identify consistent performers vs. differential picks

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

### Backend (.NET 8 API)
- **FplTeamPicker.Api** - REST API endpoints and controllers
- **FplTeamPicker.Domain** - Core business entities and contracts
- **FplTeamPicker.Services** - Business logic and use cases
- **FplTeamPicker.Optimisation** - Mathematical optimization algorithms
- **FplTeamPicker.Tests** - Unit and integration tests

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Headless UI** for accessible components

### Data Analysis (Python)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for data exploration and model training
- **Expected Points (xP) Analysis** for player performance prediction
- **Goalkeeper-specific models** for position-based optimization

## üé≤ FPL Rules & Constraints

The optimization algorithm respects all official FPL rules:

### Team Composition
- **15 total players**: 11 starting, 4 bench
- **2 Goalkeepers**: 1 starting, 1 bench
- **5 Defenders**: 3-5 can start
- **5 Midfielders**: 2-5 can start  
- **3 Forwards**: 1-3 can start
- **¬£100.0m total budget**

### Team Restrictions
- **Maximum 3 players** from any single Premier League team
- **11 starting players** must be selected each gameweek
- **Captain** scores double points, **Vice-captain** as backup

### Transfer System
- **1 free transfer** per gameweek (can bank up to 2)
- **-4 point penalty** for each additional transfer
- **Wildcard chip** allows unlimited free transfers (limited uses)

## üß† Optimization Model

### Objective Function
Maximize expected points while respecting all FPL constraints:

```
Maximize: Œ£(player_xp * selection_weight) - transfer_penalties
```

### Key Metrics
- **xP (Expected Points)** - Predicted points based on underlying statistics
- **xP per ¬£** - Value efficiency metric
- **Fixture Difficulty Rating** - Upcoming match difficulty
- **Ownership %** - Template vs. differential considerations
- **Form** - Recent performance trends

### Position-Specific Analysis
- **Goalkeepers** - Clean sheet probability, save points, bonus potential
- **Defenders** - Clean sheets, attacking returns, bonus points
- **Midfielders** - Goals, assists, clean sheet points (if playing defense)
- **Forwards** - Goals, assists, penalty taking
